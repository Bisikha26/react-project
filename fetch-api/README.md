# Why Hooks?

## > Hooks let us use **state** and other React features without writing a class.

## > Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts: props, state, context, refs and lifecycle

## > Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data), rather than forcing a split based on lifecycle methods
